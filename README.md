# Sound (from) Market #

Markets generate a lot of data over long periods of time.
We can use that to create sounds that represent various information on the market
These pieces can then be heard at least by people with a musician's ear.
It would be interesting to see numerous things. 
- whether it is possible to get an unconscious feeling for how things might go on the market

## Data in use ##

- (closing) price
- opening price
- high
- low
- [volume] currently unavailable
- change
- date

## Data Translations ##

This data is then translated to sounds.
The sounds can appear as something musical - this is coincidental or a mental construct
ie an imagination. Similar to random rhythms that are imagined to be musical in techno.
Our aim is to get the stochastic sounds to go from noise to more musically appealing 
outputs. As we develop we may find more musical translations.
Initially we aim to not lose, truncate or randomise the original data but to convey the
data in a new form.

## Translations  ##
Tranlsations go from the market history to note data to sound output via Tone.js

We have begun with a humble list of two translations

PLANS 
- price to note freq ✅
- high to note duration ✅
- [ banking holidays to pauses]
- [ volume to velocity ]
- [ market change sentiment to sentiment in chord changes]
- [ market news sentiment(we do not have the data yet!) to sentiment in chord changes]
- hao staff for additional visual, graphical data 

## Output ##

We use tone.js to create sounds from the data that has been translated from market 
information.
